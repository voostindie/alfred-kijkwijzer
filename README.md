# Alfred Workflow: Search Kijkwijzer

**Update September 2021**: as I'm not using this workflow anymore, I'm archiving it. I'm not even sure it still works.

## Introduction

Fairly often I find myself searching for a movie on the [Kijkwijzer](http://www.kijkwijzer.nl) site, to determine whether my daughter is old enough to watch a certain movie or television show.

"There should be an easier way to do that!", I thought to myself. And so this workflow was born.

I recorded the XHR requests performed by the search box on the Kijkwijzer site, and mimicked those in this workflow. That's not a stable "API" of course. Therefore this workflow might break at any time!

## Installation

Download the workflow file and double-click it. Provided you have Alfred on your machine, that should install it.

## Usage instructions

Type `kw`, a space, followed by the name of the movie or television show you wish to search for. The workflow will then list all matches from Kijkwijzer. Each match shows an icon for the minimum age advised for that match.

Opening a single match will show additional details. The first line can again be activated; it will open the match on the Kijkwijzer site in your favorite browser.
